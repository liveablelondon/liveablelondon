			<h2> Exploring the spatial distribution of neighbourhood typologies in London </h2>
			<h5> through an interactive mapping tool </h5>
		</div>
		<p>
			Every year, 200,000 people move from different parts of the UK to live in London. On top of this, people from across the world choose to make London their home too. Whether it be for work, education, business or living closer to family and friends, it is undeniable that London offers a plethora of opportunities and reasons to relocate for diverse groups of people.
		</p>
		<p>
		The myriad of options presented by London can be captivating, yet daunting at the same time. Something seemingly as straightforward as choosing where to live (if you’re in a smaller city or town) is complicated by the fact that London is huge and comprises many distinct neighbourhoods that suit the needs of particular groups of people. To simplify the process and aid your house-hunting adventures, this tool visualises the trade-offs between different liveability factors for locations across London
		</p>

	<!--
		<h6> 1. The Liveability Metric: </h6>
		<p>
			Identifying main priorities when selecting a neighbourhood. Six main indicators were chosen that best represents the main factors people consider when selecting a neighbourhood - Safety, Education, Transportation, Housing (price), Environment and Neighbourhood (open spaces). A detailed description on how each metric is calculated and their justifications can be found in the section below.
		</p>
		<h6> 2. Profiles: </h6>
		<p>
			Summarising six main groups of house-hunters, with their respective priorities. These are first time renters/students, young families, older families, professional couples, single income owners and empty nesters/retirees. Each of these profiles will have prioritise three indicators of the liveability metric. Based on these priorities or profile descriptions users can pick a profile that they identify the most with.
		</p>
		<h6> 3. Mapping Tool: </h6>
		<p>
			 Identifying your ideal neighbourhood. Selecting a profile will generate a map which identifies potential neighbourhoods (at ward level) that correspond with the selected profile’s priorities. Neighbourhoods will be grouped in clusters based on how well their scores correspond with the selected profile’s priorities, allowing users to zoom in on clusters of neighbourhoods that best suit their needs.

		<p> Each of you would have different sets of neighbourhood aspects you consider are more important when choosing an area to live in. </p>
		<p> We have identified 6 main liveability factors to investigate on this tool, which are housing, environment, green access, safety, education, and transportation. </p>

					<h2> Housing Metric </h2>
					<p> The housing metric was created by considering the 2014 median house price data across all London wards. This dataset was obtained from the London Ward Profiles and Atlas, which is provided by the Greater London Authority. Median house price was considered as it gives a better understanding of house prices compared to the mean, which includes data for exceptionally expensive sales that might not be representative of the as well. Although rental data is not included within this metric, house prices do give a good indication on the corresponding rental prices for the property. </p>

					<h2> Pollution Metric </h2>
					<p>With increased discussion around London’s air quality over the last few years, air quality is a key focus of the Mayor of London’s 2018 Environment Strategy. Particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) can be found in air samples collected from across London. Due to the small size of the particles, they may enter the bloodstream and collect in the body’s vital organs, with serious implications for the overall health of those that breathe them in.

					<h2> Open Space Metric </h2>
					<p> Green and open spaces were used as a proxy to calculate the neighbourhood metric.  The rationale for this lies in the fact that the opportunities open and green spaces provide for interaction, leisure and activities are essential factors in determining what makes a neighbourhood liveable. To create this metric, data was extracted from the 2013 London Ward Well-Being Scores, under the column “Homes with access to open space & nature, and % greenspace”. Wards are given a score that could be positive and negative, with positive scores indicating a higher probability that the population on average will experience better well-being for that corresponding metric. A score of 0 means that the ward has a score that tallies with the average value in England and Wales for that corresponding indicator. </p>

					<h2> Safety Metric </h2>
					<p> The safety metric was created using Recorded Crime data provided by the London Metropolitan Police. In particular, 2009 crime data aggregated at the London Ward level was used. Instead of analysing all crime which could skew the data towards high-traffic, touristy areas around Westminster and central London, crimes targeting homes was specifically looked at. Thus, residential burglaries was used as an indicator for safety. Wards with lower levels of home burglaries will therefore be recognised as safer in our model. </p>

					<h2> Education Metric </h2>
					<p> To compute the education metric, average GCSE scores were used. Average GCSE scores give important information regarding the educational performance of students living in a particular ward, along with potentially how well the local catchment performs in education. To create this metric, data was extracted from the 2013 London Ward Well-Being Scores, under the column “Average GCSE scores”. Wards are given a score that could be positive and negative, with positive scores indicating a higher probability that the population on average will experience better education scores. A score of 0 means that the ward has an educational standard that corresponds with the average of England and Wales. </p>

					<h2> Transportation Metric </h2>
					<p> The transportation metric is informed by the calculated Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) score, aggregated at ward level. Ranging from a value of 1 to 6, PTAL scores indicate how well connected and accessible a place is with regards to public transport. A score of 1 indicates that the corresponding ward has extremely poor access to public transport connections whereas a score of 6 indicates that the ward is very well connected to various public transport options in London. </p>
